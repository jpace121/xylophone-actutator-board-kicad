# Xylophone Actuator Board #

KiCad files for the Actuator Board for my robotic xylophone project.
The actuator holds the RGB LEDs and the solenoids, with the corresponding
interface circuits to the Micrcontroller. The is connected to these
components using ribbon cable and its own "shield", whose CAD files
will be in a yet to be created repository.
